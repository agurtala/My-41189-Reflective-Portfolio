## Week 1

### What have I learnt this week?

Complex systems can behave in different ways from the sum of their part which cannot be managed by just looking at the elements. 

This week I learned about:

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

The notion of a system can vary depending on the individual and how they perceive the attributes, boundaries and complexity. 

### What insights have I gained?

The concept of a system and the complexity of how it is used depending on the factors involved. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

My weakness is not asking for help from my lecturers and tutors when I don't necessarily understand. 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

The challenges I can forsee in me is understanding the content delievered through the workshops via zoom. However, in order for me not to fall behind or get lost with the content deleivered. I would need to make sure and be on top of doing the pre and post work. 

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

I would need to step outside my comfort zone in asking questions or seeking help when I do not understand.
